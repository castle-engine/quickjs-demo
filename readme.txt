Snake Game.

This is an example of a very simple game featuring:
* graphics with spritesheets,
* text output,
* keyboard/mouse input,
* read&write text files,
* sound & music,
* timer,
* Log,
* random -
basically everything you might need to start making a simple 2D game in Castle Game Engine.

You'll have to put Castle Game Engine dll's in the system PATH on Windows or keep them in game folder
On Linux you'll have to install the dependencies (Debian packages reference):
libopenal1
libpng
zlib1g
libvorbis
libgtkglext1

And the following packages are needed to compile the game:
libopenal-dev
libpng-dev
zlib1g-dev
libvorbis-dev
libgtkglext1-dev
